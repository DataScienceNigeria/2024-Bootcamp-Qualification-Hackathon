# DSN AI Bootcamp Qualification 2024 - Machine Learning with Azure and Python Track

## Welcome to the DSN AI Bootcamp Qualification 2024 Hackathon!

Are you ready to take on a challenge that will not only showcase your data science skills but also make a significant impact on a prominent real estate company in Nigeria? Welcome to the DSN AI Bootcamp Qualification 2023 Hackathon in the Machine Learning with Azure and Python track!

## About the Hackathon

The challenge at hand revolves around the creation of a sophisticated predictive model aimed at determining the likelihood of an individual having heart disease. As one of the leading causes of global mortality, detecting heart disease in its early stages is pivotal for enhancing patient outcomes and halting its progression. Conventional diagnostic methods often come with substantial costs and time requirements. Thus, there exists a pressing need for a cutting-edge predictive model that can evaluate the risk of heart disease utilizing easily accessible patient information.


## The Objective

The objective of this challenge is to design and build a predictive model capable of accurately determining the probability of an individual having heart disease. The focus is on leveraging machine learning techniques to create a model that can analyze relevant features and provide reliable predictions. The model should demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability, ensuring its effectiveness on new, unseen data.

## Why Participate?
Solving this challenge holds great significance. Early prediction aids in timely intervention and prevention, optimizing healthcare resources. The cost-effectiveness of predictive models reduces unnecessary procedures, benefiting patients and healthcare systems. Targeted public health efforts can stem from aggregated data, and research also advances through model insights. Ultimately, this challenge addresses a crucial healthcare issue using advanced machine learning, promising improved interventions and better health outcomes

## Judging Criteria

The error metric for this competition is Accuracy.

For every row in the dataset, submission files should contain 2 columns: ID and Target.
